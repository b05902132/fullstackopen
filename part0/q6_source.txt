    In q5, the browser already rendered the page,
    and registered a callback on the form,
    which fires when the user submits the form.
end note

user -> browser: fills the form and clicks submit

note over browser
The callback on the form reads the form,
creates an object which contains the form and current time.
It appends the object to the existing list named 'notes',
modifies the DOM so it shows the new list.
It then creates an XMLHTTPRequst that contains this object,
registers a callback, and sends the request.
end note

browser -> server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa \n {"content": ..., "date": ...}
server --> browser: HTTP 201 {"message":"note created"}

note over browser
The callback runs when the the response is received,
and logs the response.
end note
